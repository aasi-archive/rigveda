# THE RIG VEDA (digitized)

This repository contains the code for the digitized Rig-Veda. The Python script `rv2html.py` turns the Rig Veda JSON data into a series of beautiful HTMLs.

The `rig-veda-audio.json` contains the URLs for the audio recitations of the Rig Veda which are hosted on Google Drive.

The query search engine uses AASI-Flask-Server project and that in turn uses VedaWeb's API.
